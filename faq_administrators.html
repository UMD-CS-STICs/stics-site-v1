                <h2>How do course numbers work for STICs?</h2>
                <p>This is up to the department. Most departments are using special topics numbers (as they are perfect for one-off courses like this). Some other departments have created other numbers.</p>
                <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Once a course is created, things like the grading policy (pass/fail vs. standard letter grades) cannot be changed. In other words, if there is a course from 2009 that is P/F and a STIC wants to use that course number, it MUST be P/F.</p>
                <h2>How should teaching load be split in the scheduler?</h2>
                <p>The faculty advisor should be given <b>100%</b> of the teaching load. Even though student-facilitators are helping teach, they should not be listed as taking fractions of teaching load.</p>
                <h2>If students are the ones teaching, how are course evaluations handled?</h2>
                <p>Please note that even though students are the ones teaching, they should not be listed as instructors of record for classes. This means that on the course evals, the only person listed will be the faculty advisor. This is not ideal, as students may fill out course evals for the faculty advisor thinking it was for student facilitators.</p>
                <p>Currently, each faculty advisor chooses how to handle this. Some advisors ask the class to fill it out as if it were for the facilitators. Some advisors ask the class not to fill it out at all.</p>
                <h2>Who handles grading/grade disputes?</h2>
                <p>While the student-facilitators may handle intermediate grading on assignments like projects and quizzes, the instructor of record will be the one submitting final grades. The instructor of record also handles any grade disputes that escalate past a certain point.</p>
                <h2>What happens if a student facilitator becomes unable to teach a course?</h2>
                <p>Hopefully the STIC has two facilitators so the other can take over. However, if this does not happen, the responsibility falls on the faculty advisor to decide what happens to the course + students.</p>
                <h2>How are student facilitators compensated?</h2>
                <p>It depends on the department the class falls under. Some departments may pay facilitators as TAs, some may require it to be volunteer service, and some may offer credit as a sort of independent study.</p>
                <h2>What are the responsibilities of a faculty advisor?</h2>
                <p>For an informal summary of the role, check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c81bq5qzxsRwFHC6SItoWc0ya5Zxa4Bq7NvIAlWlfCc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this</a> document.</p>
                <h2>How many credits are STICs?</h2>
                <p>STICs are offered from 1 to 2 credits.</p>
